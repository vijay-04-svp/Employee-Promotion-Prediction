# Employee-Promotion-Prediction
This is a simple project that predicts whether or not an employee will be promoted based on a variety of factors. To complete this project, I used a dataset from kaggle.
SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier are the four Machine Learning Algorithms that I used.
SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest results were combined to create the Voting Classifier.

The accuracy of each of the four classifiers was then compared, with the highest accuracy being used to predict the output class.

XGBoost had the highest accuracy in this case, so it was used to make the prediction.
